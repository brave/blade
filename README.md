# BLaDE: BatteryLab and Device Evaluations

BLaDE (formerly known as BatteryLab) is an open-source platform for automated performance evaluations on mobile phones (Android and iOS). It is capable of recording power consumption (using a [Monsoon HV Power Monitor](https://www.msoon.com/high-voltage-power-monitor)), CPU usage, memory, and network traffic (bandwidth) using different types of automation methods (ADB for Android, BT for iOS/Android).

For setup instructions, refer to [this document](src/setup/README.md).
