# BLaDE: BatteryLab and Device Evaluations

BLaDE (formerly known as BatteryLab) is an open-source platform for comprehensive performance evaluations on mobile devices, supporting both Android and iOS. The platform provides automated measurement and monitoring capabilities for:

- Power consumption (via [Monsoon HV Power Monitor](https://www.msoon.com/high-voltage-power-monitor))
- CPU and memory usage
- Device temperature
- Network traffic analysis (bandwidth and per-app data usage)
- Remote device control

BLaDE leverages multiple automation methods including ADB for Android and Bluetooth for iOS/Android. For detailed setup instructions and configuration options, please refer to our [setup guide](src/setup/README.md).
